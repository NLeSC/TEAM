Team Ctrl-c

This team will work on four prioritized communication areas relating to the Research Software Directory: Corporate website expertise pages, RSD maintenance behavior, RSD front-end development, and developing software statements. 
We are looking for:

   - People with knowledge of our expertise, with ideas on how to get that across in a concise and attractive matter
   - People who want to think about communication concepts (think about nudges, incentives, campaigns) for maintaining information in the RSD and keeping this up to date (both in stimulating your colleagues as well as PI’s/project teams)
   - People that want to talk with other teams to define why/who/how/what of each software package, to develop a ‘software statement’

 
What this team aims to achieve in the sprint (depending on size and availability of team):

    1. Rethink expertise content corporate website
    
       Our expertise pages on the corporate website do not clarify well to an uninformed audience what it is that we bring to a scientific project. Currently our expertise pages (https://www.esciencecenter.nl/?/expertise) are a 
       direct copy from our organizational strategy 2015-2020 document. During the sprint we want to

        - Rewrite and present this content in a format that is more accessible to people with limited knowledge of ICT.
        - Conceptualize how we can present the ‘proof of the pudding’ here (our gems, how to establish a link with the RSD, and our publications for example).

    2. End-of-project report inventory/update and recommendations
        - Inventory
        - Data in the RSD regarding completed projects might be missing or out-of-date. We will make an inventory of all output in end-of-project reports and add this to RSD database, to complete the blanks.
        - Communication concepts for stimulating maintenance behavior
        - Create a document with recommendations on how to collect this information in the future, and define ownership of maintenance. On challenge we foresee is how to keep the RSD up to date. Which content has to be maintained manually, where will responsibility for that maintenance lie and how can communication contribute to stimulate the right behavior/actions towards an up to date RSD. 

    3. Kick-off front-end development RSD

       While the back-end is currently being developed by Tom K, development of the front end will start from scratch. On Wednesday an external agency will join to explore the points of departure for (co-)developing the front-end of 
       the new Research Software Directory. The agenda and persons involved in this meeting have already been defined (Lode, Tom K, Willem, Rob).
    
    4. Software statements

       For each gem we want to develop a statement along the lines “For [these users] this [software] is the [what makes software unique from user perspective] among all [with which types of software does it compete] because [proof 
       that it is unique by mentioning characteristics]. Defining these software statements is a joint-effort of all teams.
