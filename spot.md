SPOT is a web-based visual analytics tool. I can be used to create and share dashboards to visualize tabular data stored in relational databases, or CSV and JSON files. SPOT uses common visual analytics ideas like multiple coordinated views and drill down.

In this team project sprint we will be working on finishing the 1.0 release of SPOT. The main tasks will be:
- Packaging spot-server and spot-framework and publishing these on npm
- User documentation and improvement of the help functionality
- Building a show case demo with open data
- Improving the consistency of the default appearance of the plots and layout of the web client.
