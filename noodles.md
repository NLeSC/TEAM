# Noodles (Johan) 

Noodles is a programming model to do task-based parallel and concurrent programming in 100% Python. Its primary goal is to make it *easier* to write or modify Python code to work in a parallel environment. The user enters a Python 
script that looks and feels like a serial program. The Noodles engine then converts this script into a call graph. This graph can be executed on a variety of machines using the different back-ends that Noodles provides. Noodles 
applications scale from running on your laptop to computer clusters through the Xenon middleware. As a programming model, Noodles is largely inspired on functional programming techniques.

## Sprint Program

### Dissemination: 
 
- Improve the website, questions: what is noodles? when should I use it? who is already using it?

### Tutorials:
- Noodlify your favourite Python module
- Staging a remote run using Xenon

### Documentation:
- Development documentation

### The Checklist:
- see: https://nlesc.gitbooks.io/guide/content/software/checklist.html

### Testing:
- Systematic testing of programming idioms on different back-ends: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/parametrize.html
