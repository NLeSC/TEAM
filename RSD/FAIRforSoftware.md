# Open Science 

Open Science is an important part of out work at the NLeSC. We have open calls, we require open access papers, open data, and open source software, and a data management and software sustainability plan.

Where open access and open data are broadly accepted as an integral part of open science, open software is often forgotten or ignored. We feel open software is an essential part of open science. For most of research, software is an essential tool to produce the scientific results. Without the software, reproducing or extending existing work is hard if not impossible, even if the data and papers are open. 

Therefore, we feel research software should be open, just like research data and papers. However, simply producing open source software is not enough. As with open data simply providing a download link and permissive licence is only the start. As described in [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618): 

_"Beyond proper collection, annotation, and archival, data stewardship includes the notion of ‘long-term care’ of valuable digital assets, with the goal that they should be discovered and re-used for downstream investigations, either alone, or in combination with newly generated data."_ 

## Why is software different from data ?

Although orginally indented for data, most of these principles also apply to research software. Like open data, we feel software should be FAIR, that is _Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable_. However, software is not simply data: 

- software is dynamic instead of static
- software requires a context to work (hardware, other software, data)
- software requires expertise to apply. Storing the software without storing this expertise does not makes sense. 
- like data, software contains errors. However, the effect of these errors in software have different effects than in data. For example, you cannot filter out "outliers" in software.
- software tends to age which makes archival and reproducability a problem. Hardware and software dependencies tend to change or disappear. 

Interestingly, data in itself does not age. Typically, problems with reading old data formats are caused software aging, but not by the data itself. 

## FAIR for data

From the FAIR website, FAIR for data stands for _Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable_.

In more detail:

__Findable:__ 

F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.  
F2. data are described with rich metadata.  
F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.  
F4. metadata specify the data identifier.  
 
__Accessible:__

A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.  
A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.  
A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.  
A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.  

__Interoperable:__

I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.  
I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.  
I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.  

__Re-usable:__

R1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.  
R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.  
R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.  
R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.  

## Question: How to apply this to Software ? 

Below we translate the FAIR principles to software:

__Findable:__ 

F1. software releases are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.  
F2. data are described with rich metadata.  
F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.  
F4. metadata specify the data identifier.  
 
__Accessible:__

A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.  
A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.  
A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.  
A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.  

__Interoperable:__

I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.  
I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.  
I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.  

__Re-usable:__

R1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.  
R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.  
R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.  
R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.
