# Overview 

Each year we organize an NLeSC-wide team project with the following goals:

  - eStep: producing generic tools, knowledge and research for eStep.
  - Team building: get to know your (new) colleagues, their interests, skills, knowledge, etc.
  - Knowledge sharing & development: learn from each other and collectively learn new skills.

The team project is organized as a number of sprints. For this year's project these will take place on:

   - 18-21 September
   - 13-16 November

Traditionally, on the last day (Thursday) we end with a dinner at the eScience Center.

The focus of this years team project is our own software, the 'gems' of eStep. We will have 6 teams, each focusing on a specific tool and polishing it to perfection:

   - CWL (Niels)
   - Spot (Willem)
   - McFly (Christiaan)
   - Pointclouds (Stefan)
   - CommonSense (Berend)
   - Noodles (Johan)

Since the NLeSC will be evaluated next year, it is very important that we can show off all the great tools we have created. Dissemination of the tools and their presence on the Research Software Directory (previously known as the eStep website) will play a prominent role during these sprints. Therefore, we'll have a 7th team to help everyone present their tools in an optimal way:

   - Dissemination & Research Software Directory (Lode)

Each team should come up with a short abstract describing the tool they are going to work on, and a plan of the work that will be done in the first sprint. Please focus on things like:

  - Dissemination   
  - Tutorials
  - Documentation
  - The Checklist
  - Packaging
  - Testing
  - Urgent missing features and bug-fixes

in that particular order.
